# Jquery-form
 The Jquery form validates the username and password entered by the user based on following criteria
username should start in capital letters
--> password should have only small letters and numbers
successful login --> it should redirect to another page
Another Page details --> HTML5 page, the page should include header, footer, article and sidebar

This shows the form validation when we enter the username that does not match the condition, like we enter username parmarp

This shows the form validation when we enter password that does not match the condition, for example password par__123
